This project contains four classes: Card, Deck, Hand, testGame.
Card class models a real life Card.
Deck class models a real life Deck.
Hand class models a real life hand.
testGame is the driver class. It has pre-written methods to demonstrate all methods of the hand class. Some code has been commented out so as to output a desired result. In order to test those methods, remove the "//".
I have inserted all necessary comments so my code can be comprehensible.
The hand class has methods for checking what type of hand it is, and comparing hands to print out the winner. They have also been extensively commented on.
A few tricks I used that might not seem readily apparent:
In the event of a hand being a straight flush with a low Ace, my sort method changes "Ace"(which has value 14) to "A"(which has value 1) and uses recursion to resort them.
In order to demonstrate problem 4, I had to make a second constructor for the hand class which takes a string as its parameter. I then use the charAt method to read each character of the string sequence and use assign it to either the rank or suit of a card within the hand Array.
